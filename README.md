# Stock-Analysis with VBA
## Overview of Project 

### Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to take the code and refactor it to make it run more efficiently in VBA. The code focused on collecting data from stocks' past track records to see the return on investment percentages over a two-year window. 


### Results
Using the VBA code I was able to collect data on several stocks at once over the course of two years to see which ones would yield the best percentage return. The images below show the tables generated from the VBA code. In 2017 only one stock had a negative return while the rest showed promising results. However, in 2018 only two stocks yielded a positive return. The refactored code showed a slight improvement in processing time. If the code was run on a slower machine with less memory I can see how refactoring the code can be extremely useful.

## Summary
### 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The main advantage of refactoring code is the reduction in runtime that is required for the user to execute and run commands. The disadvantage to refactoring is the amount of time that is needed to polish off the code and some of the data might get skipped over.    

### 2.	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
From what I have learned refactoring code requires less memory to run commands making it easier for more machines to run the code. Another pro is the code can look more polished. Using less memory can be a con however because if you are working with large sets of data refactored code might miss or skip over important data.
